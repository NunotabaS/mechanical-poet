"one day in the fall / of 1906 the british / scientist francis / galton left his home / in the town of plymouth headed / for a country fair","galton was eighty / five years old beginning to / feel his age but he / was still brimming with / the curiosity that / had won him renown / notoriety / for his work on statistics / the science of heredity","on that particular / day what galton was curious / about was livestock"
"galtons destination / was the annual west of / england fat stock poultry / exhibition a / regional fair where the local / farmers townspeople / gathered to appraise / the quality of each others / cattle sheep chickens / horses pigs","wandering through rows / of stalls examining workhorses / prize hogs may seem to / have been a strange way / for a scientist especially / an elderly one / to spend an afternoon / but there was a certain logic / to it","galtonwas a man / obsessed with two things the measurement / of physical mental / qualities breeding"
"what after all is / a live stock show but a big / showcase for the effects / of good bad breeding / breeding mattered to galton / because he believed / that only avery / few people had the characteristics / necessary to / keep societies / healthy","he had devoted / much of his career to measuring / those characteristics / in fact in order / to prove that the vast majority / ofpeople did not / have them","at the international / exhibition of 1884 / in london for instance / he set up an anthropometric / laboratory where he used / devices of his / own making to test / exhibition goerson among / other things their keenness / of sight of hearing / colour sense judgment of eye / reaction time"
"his experiments / left him with little faith in / the intelligence / of the average / person the stupidity / wrong headedness of / many men women / being so great as to be / scarcely credible","only if power / control stayed in the hands of / the select well bred / few galton believed / could a society remain / healthy strong","as he walked through the / exhibition that day galton / came across a weight / judging competition"
"a fat ox had been / selected placed on display / members of a gathering / crowd were lining upto / place wagers on the weight of / the ox","or rather they were / placing wagers on what the / weight of the ox would / be after it had / been slaughtered dressed","for six pence you could / buy a stamped numbered ticket / where you filled in your / name your address your / estimate"
"the best guesses would / receive prizes / eight hundred people / tried their luck / they were a diverse / lot","many of them were / butchers farmers who were presumably / ex pert at judging / the weight of livestock / but there were also quite a / few people who had / as it were no insider / knowledge of cattle","many non experts / competed galton wrote later / in the scientific / journal nature like / those clerks others who have no / expert knowledge of / horses but who bet / on races guided by newspapers / friends their own fancies"
