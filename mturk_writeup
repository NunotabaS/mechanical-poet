Rephrase a sentence based on syllables and content

Introduction:
We divide sentences according to syllables. You need to rephrase them to a 5-7-5 syllable structure without changing the core content. 

Keywords:
rephrase, sentence, linguistic, poetry, literature

Instructions:
You're alowed to delete whole section of a sentence, or move words across different sections. The initial division is just to assist you in rephrasing the sentences.
The core content of a sentence includes subject, verb and object. You can add other parts based on their relevance. 
One way to determine syllables is to find  independent "a", "e", "i", "o", "u", which means "ae", "ou", "eo" count as one syllable. For example "apple" has two syllables.
Hopefully, we can break the sentences naturally into the 5-7-5 syllable structure. If not, we can just try to get as close as possible. 
For those very short sentences, it's ok to only fill in the first one or two parts of the syllable structure. 
We only provide 6 text areas even though some sentences are quite long. We encourage you to make the sentence consice and succinct
